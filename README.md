# 4155-study-project

## Project Introduction
Hello! This is our project for ITSC-4155. The aim of our project is to create a study helper for each user! We will accomplish this through this initial functionality:
 1. Letting users sign up
 2. Once a user is signed in, prompt the user to create their studyset
 3. Once a studyset is created, the user will be given a list of options (flashcards, tests) to study in their favorite medium.
